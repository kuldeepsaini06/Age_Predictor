## Project Description: 
Age of Marriage prediction is to calculate the right age of the person for marriage using various feature columns.we will be looking at marriage age. We will build a Machine learning model to predict the person age, Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error to measure performance of our model.
## Database Description:

Number of Instances: 2567

Number of Attributes: 10 including the Churn Class

## Attribute Information:
Target column :- Age of Marriage is the target column
Feature Columns:- id, Gender, Height, Religion, Caste, Mother Tongue, Profession, Location, Country
Here 8 couluns are non numeric and 2 columns are numeric

## Libraries Involved:
1. pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Sklearn

## Steps Involved:
1. Importing the libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data Preprocessing
4. train and test data split
5. Building the model
6. Compare model performance
7. selection model based on performance
8. Evaluation 

## Machine Learning Steps Involved
1. Multiple Algorithm used 
   * LinearRegression
   * DecisionTreeRegressor
   * RandomForestRegressor
   * AdaBoostRegressor
   * XGBRegressor
   * XGBRFRegressor
2. Find best Algorithm is RandomForestRegressor
